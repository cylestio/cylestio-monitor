# Cylestio Monitor Synthetic Data Generator

This tool generates synthetic monitoring data for the Cylestio Monitor system. It creates realistic monitoring events for five different AI agents over a one-month period, with varied event types, alert levels, and metrics.

## Features

- Generates data for five specialized agents:
  - `weather-agent`: Handling weather queries
  - `finance-agent`: Processing financial transactions or market data
  - `healthcare-agent`: Managing patient data queries or alerts
  - `retail-agent`: Tracking e-commerce or store activity
  - `security-agent`: Monitoring cybersecurity events

- Creates various event types across different channels:
  - LLM events (call start, finish, blocked, error)
  - MCP events (tool call start, finish, error, patch)
  - System events (monitoring enabled/disabled, config updates, agent registration)
  - Security events (alerts, scans, policy updates)
  - Custom events (user queries, API requests, data processing, report generation)

- Includes realistic alert levels:
  - None (normal operation)
  - Suspicious (potentially concerning activity)
  - Dangerous (harmful or malicious activity)

- Generates agent-specific data with domain-relevant fields
- Creates realistic timestamps with higher activity during business hours
- Varies event frequency based on weekdays vs. weekends

## Directory Contents

- `generate_synthetic_data.py`: Main script that generates the synthetic data
- `test_data_generation.py`: Script to verify the generated data
- `visualize_data.py`: Script to create visualizations of the data
- `run_demo.sh`: Shell script to run all tools in sequence
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required to run the scripts
- `*.png`: Visualization files generated by the demo

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- SQLite3
- Optional: matplotlib and pandas (for visualization)

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed
2. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd tools/synthetic_data_generator
   ```
3. Run the demo script:
   ```bash
   ./run_demo.sh
   ```

The script will:
1. Create or connect to the SQLite database at `~/.cylestio/monitor.db`
2. Generate synthetic data for the past 30 days
3. Insert the data into the database
4. Test the generated data
5. Create visualizations

## Customization

You can modify the scripts to:
- Change the time period by editing the `start_date` and `end_date` variables
- Adjust the number of events per day by modifying the `events_per_day_per_agent` parameter
- Add or modify event types in the `EVENT_TYPES` dictionary
- Customize agent-specific data by editing the data generator functions

## Data Structure

The generated data follows the Cylestio Monitor database schema:

### Agents Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `agent_id`: Unique identifier for the agent
- `created_at`: When the agent was first seen
- `last_seen`: When the agent was last seen

### Events Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `agent_id`: Foreign key to the agents table
- `event_type`: Type of event (e.g., "LLM_call_start")
- `channel`: Channel of the event (e.g., "LLM", "MCP", "SYSTEM")
- `level`: Log level (e.g., "info", "warning", "error")
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- `data`: JSON data containing the event details

## Security Features

The synthetic data includes security-related events with:
- Suspicious keywords detection
- Dangerous keywords detection
- Appropriate alert levels and actions
