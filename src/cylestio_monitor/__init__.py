"""Cylestio Monitor - A monitoring tool for LLM API calls and AI agents.

This module provides comprehensive monitoring for AI applications, automatically detecting
and instrumenting various libraries and frameworks including:

- Anthropic Claude client (auto-detected)
- LangChain (auto-detected)
- LangGraph (auto-detected)
- MCP (Machine Conversation Protocol)
- LangChain Tools & Tool Decorators (auto-detected)

Basic usage:
```python
from cylestio_monitor import start_monitoring

# Start monitoring at the beginning of your application
start_monitoring(agent_id="my-agent")

# Your application code here...
# The monitor will automatically detect and instrument supported libraries

# When finished, stop monitoring
from cylestio_monitor import stop_monitoring
stop_monitoring()
```
