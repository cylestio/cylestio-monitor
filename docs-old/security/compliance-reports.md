# Security Compliance

Cylestio Monitor is designed with security and compliance at its core. We implement rigorous security practices and testing protocols to help you meet your regulatory requirements.

## Security Standards

Our development and testing processes are aligned with industry best practices and security standards:

- **SOC2**: Our development and release processes follow SOC2 security principles
- **HIPAA**: Built-in safeguards help protect sensitive healthcare information
- **GDPR**: Configurable data handling options to support privacy requirements
- **ISO 27001**: Alignment with information security management best practices

## Security Testing

Every release of Cylestio Monitor undergoes extensive security testing:

- **Static code analysis** to detect potential vulnerabilities
- **Dependency scanning** to identify vulnerable dependencies
- **Dynamic security testing** of the running application
- **Manual code reviews** by security experts

## Pre-commit Security Hooks

Cylestio Monitor incorporates pre-commit and pre-push hooks that run security checks before any code changes are committed or pushed to the repository. These hooks ensure:

- No credentials or secrets are accidentally committed
- No vulnerable dependencies are introduced
- No common security issues are present in the code
- All security tests pass before code is pushed

## Continuous Security Monitoring

In addition to pre-release testing, we maintain continuous security monitoring:

- **Dependency monitoring** for new vulnerabilities
- **Scheduled security scans** of the codebase
- **Penetration testing** of the application
- **Security regression testing** with each release

## Security Reporting

When using Cylestio Monitor in your environment, you can generate security reports to demonstrate compliance with your organization's security requirements:

```python
from cylestio_monitor.security import generate_security_report

# Generate a comprehensive security report
report = generate_security_report(
    agent_id="my-agent",
    time_period_days=30,
    include_alerts=True,
    include_blocked_attempts=True,
    include_performance=True,
    format="pdf"  # or "json", "csv", "html"
)

# Save the report
report.save("/path/to/security-report.pdf")
```

## Data Handling and Privacy

Cylestio Monitor is designed to respect data privacy:

- All monitoring data is stored locally by default
- No data is sent to external servers without explicit configuration
- PII detection helps identify sensitive information
- Data retention policies can be configured to meet compliance requirements

## Future Compliance Roadmap

We are continuously working to enhance our security and compliance features:

- **SOC2 Certification**: In progress
- **HIPAA Compliance Assessment**: Scheduled for Q3 2024
- **FedRAMP Alignment**: Under evaluation
- **Enhanced Encryption**: Coming in version 0.6.0
